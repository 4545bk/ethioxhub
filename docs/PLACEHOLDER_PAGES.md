# 🚧 Placeholder Pages Added

## ✅ Changes Made
I've replaced the **404 Error Pages** with a sleek "Coming Soon" page for the following menu items:
- 🎥 **COURSE VIDEOS** (`/videos`)
- 🏷️ **CATEGORIES** (`/categories`)
- 🔴 **LIVE SESSIONS** (`/live`)
- 🎓 **INSTRUCTORS** (`/instructors`)
- 👥 **STUDY GROUPS** (`/groups`)
- 💬 **COMMUNITY** (`/community`)
- 📚 **RESOURCES** (`/resources`)

## 🎨 Features
- **Working Navbar**: Users can still navigate away easily.
- **Custom Message**: Each page explicitly says which feature is being worked on.
- **Home Button**: A clear "Return to Home Page" button.

## 🚀 How to Verify
1.  Click any of the links in the top navigation bar (e.g., "COMMUNITY").
2.  **Result**: Instead of an error, you will see the new "Coming Soon" page.
